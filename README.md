# Doomsday

This is a set of scripts aimed at training someone to memorize days of the week, specifically with the [Doomsday Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule).

The Python file aims at repetitive training and explanation, and the shell script aims at training once per day by quizzing the user on terminal start.

Have fun!
